 * @brief Cucumber runtime runs, naturally.
 * @details When running the wire server, there are two timing
 * requirements. First, wait at least for a nominal 10 seconds before giving up
 * on taking a connection. Call this the "connect timeout" period; it defines
 * the maximum delay in-between setting up the server and making the first
 * wire-client connection. There must be at least one incoming Cucumber
 * connection to disable this timeout. When a connection activates, the timeout
 * becomes infinite. Provided at least one connection remains, the server
 * continues running indefinitely. When the last connection closes, the wire
 * server sustains the server socket for one more second before exiting. This
 * allows for execution of Cucumber commands over multiple socket connections in
 * rapid sequence. Call this the disconnect timeout. You can adjust the connect
 * and disconnect timeouts accordingly.

 * connections if you ignore the running status. In such event, the is-running
 * status will revert to YES when incoming new connections establish.
